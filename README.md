# Raycraft
Raycraft is a simple voxel raytracer using Minecraft worlds written in Pike.
It's a learning project for me as I had never done any raytracing before, so the algorithm is absolutely terrible, but it works :)
It also includes a simple parser for Minecraft worlds which is decoupled from the rest of the project.

I'm not really working on this anymore as I'm writing a modular raytracer in C++ instead, but I've made it available for reference.
