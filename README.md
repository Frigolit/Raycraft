# Raycraft
Raycraft is a simple voxel raytracer using Minecraft worlds written in Pike.
It's a learning project for me as I had never done any raytracing before, so the algorithm is absolutely terrible, but it works :)
It also includes a simple parser for Minecraft worlds which is decoupled from the rest of the project.

This project is mainly an experiment and a playground if you will for experimenting with raytracing, so it may change or break quite heavily over time.
